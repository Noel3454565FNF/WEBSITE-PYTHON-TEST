            Such a day that would Be ideal to enjoy
            Preferably with everyone You’ve befriended
            Wait, I forgot They were all dead!
            
            Why is this the path That you have chosen?
            I don’t understand your emotions
            But, to be frank, I don’t have the emotions of a killer!
            
            He told me plenty of things That you have done
            Falling down to kill All those I love
            The power that you contain, Determination!
            I will take it from you
            
            Your resets, make new Timelines in our own world
            Your wrongdoings make Everything worse you see
